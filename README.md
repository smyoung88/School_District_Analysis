# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
Analysis on 15 High Schools was compiled for a school board to provide a succinct summary on various metrics for those schools. Upon review of the analysis, the school board gave notification that evidence of academic dishonesty was detected for Thomas High School's ninth grade reading and math scores which appeared to have been altered. Because of this, the board asked that Thomas High School's math and reading scores be nullified (replaced with NaNs) until the full extent of academic dishonesty had been vetted and new analysis be ran on the updated dataset to see what kind of impact this has on the different metrics.
